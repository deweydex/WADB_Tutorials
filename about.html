            <h1>About This Tutorial</h1>
            
            <section style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">
                <h2>Pedagogical Approach</h2>
                
                <p>This tutorial series is designed with specific educational principles in mind, informed by research and best practices in adult learning and critical pedagogy. The approach emphasizes <strong>student-centered learning</strong>, <strong>accessibility</strong>, and <strong>practical application</strong>.</p>
                
                <h3>Teaching Philosophy</h3>
                
                <p>The educational philosophy behind this tutorial draws from several important thinkers and practitioners in education:</p>
                
                <p><strong>Paulo Freire</strong> emphasized dialogical learning and problem-posing education that engages learners as active participants rather than passive recipients. This tutorial encourages you to experiment, make mistakes, and learn through practice rather than memorization.</p>
                
                <p><strong>John Dewey</strong> argued that education should connect to life experiences and that learning happens through doing. Throughout these tutorials, you'll work with real examples, build actual projects, and see how concepts apply to practical situations.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Alfie Kohn</strong> critiques traditional grading and emphasizes intrinsic motivation over external rewards. This tutorial focuses on learning for understanding rather than simply completing assignments. Assessment is <em>for</em> learning, not just <em>of</em> learning—each practice exercise helps you understand concepts better.</p>
                
                <p><strong>bell hooks</strong> wrote about engaged pedagogy and teaching practices that acknowledge and honor diverse student experiences. This tutorial assumes no prior knowledge, provides multiple ways to understand concepts, and recognizes that learners come with different backgrounds and learning styles.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Patrick J. Finn</strong> and <strong>Robert P. Moses</strong> both emphasized the importance of making knowledge accessible and demystifying technical subjects. This tutorial breaks down web development concepts into clear, understandable explanations without assuming prior technical knowledge.</p>
                
                <h3>Core Educational Principles</h3>
                
                <p><strong>Scaffolding</strong>: Concepts are introduced gradually, with each lesson building on previous knowledge. You start with the basics of HTML before moving to CSS, and build from simple examples to more complex projects. This ensures you have a solid foundation before tackling more advanced topics.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Transparency</strong>: Learning outcomes are stated clearly at the beginning of each lesson. You know exactly what you'll be able to do after completing each section. Examples of completed work are provided so you can see what success looks like.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Multiple Representations</strong>: Concepts are explained in prose, demonstrated with code examples, and reinforced through practice exercises. Different learners process information differently, so multiple approaches help ensure understanding.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Equity and Accessibility</strong>: This tutorial is designed to be accessible to learners from diverse backgrounds. Technical terms are defined when introduced, concepts are explained without assuming prior knowledge, and the structure accommodates different learning speeds and styles.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Critical Thinking</strong>: Rather than just memorizing syntax, you're encouraged to understand <em>why</em> things work the way they do. Each concept includes explanations of the reasoning behind it, helping you develop analytical skills that extend beyond this specific tutorial.</p>
                
                <h3>Content Structure</h3>
                
                <p>Each lesson follows a consistent structure designed to support learning:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong>: Clear statements of what you'll be able to do after completing the lesson</li>
                    <li><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: What you need to know before starting (often nothing for early lessons)</li>
                    <li><strong>Conceptual Explanations</strong>: Prose explanations that explain the "why" behind concepts, not just the "what"</li>
                    <li><strong>Worked Examples</strong>: Complete, step-by-step examples showing how to apply concepts</li>
                    <li><strong>Practice Opportunities</strong>: Exercises with graduated difficulty to build skills gradually</li>
                    <li><strong>Bibliography</strong>: References to quality educational resources for further learning</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>This structure is informed by educational research showing that explicit learning objectives, worked examples, and deliberate practice all contribute to effective learning outcomes.</p>

                <h2>How to Use This Tutorial</h2>
                
                <p>This tutorial is designed to guide you from complete beginner to publishing your own website. Here are some recommendations for getting the most out of your learning:</p>
                
                <h3>Learning Path</h3>
                
                <p>Start with the lessons in order, beginning with <strong>HTML Basics</strong>. Each lesson builds on previous concepts, so working through them sequentially helps you understand how everything connects. Don't rush—take time to complete the practice exercises and experiment with the examples provided.</p>
                
                <p>As you progress through lessons, refer to the code examples when you need to see concepts in action. Study how the examples are structured and try modifying them to see how changes affect the result. Use the starter templates when you're ready to build your own projects—they provide foundations you can customize.</p>
                
                <h3>Practice and Experimentation</h3>
                
                <p>Web development is a skill built through practice. Every lesson includes opportunities to apply what you've learned. Take time to experiment, make mistakes, and learn from them. This tutorial provides the foundation, but your curiosity and practice will take you further.</p>
